                                So a lot has happened since our last mock draft… Free agency signings and trades galore have altered many teams draft needs
                                and even draft position. With that being said, here’s CST’s official Mock Draft version 3.0.
                                Make sure to go check out Version 1.0 and Version 2.0 of our mock drafts to compare and contrast the differences.

                                I am flip-flopping a lot on this pick, but I am still convinced 
                                that Saquon Barkley SHOULD be taken 1st. That being said,
                                the Tyrod Taylor trade convinces me that they will pick Darnold 
                                at 1. Tyrod is being looked at as a ‘bridge QB’ in this scenario
                                and Cleveland looks to want their franchise QB for years to come. 
                                Yes, I do believe Saquon is a once-in-a-generation running
                                back and that they should take him here… but I can realistically 
                                see them going QB at 1 to ensure they get the guy they want.
                            </p>

                                After the NFL Combine that took place last weekend in Indianapolis, I felt a second version of my mock draft was certainly
                                needed. Mock draft season lives, and many more drafts will be released in between now and April 26th.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                The second version of CST’s official Mock Draft takes into account all the moves NFL teams have made from the release of
                                the first mock draft until now. As well, this mock draft is the first mock draft in the series that will take into
                                account the results of the recent NFL Combine.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Just a reminder that this Mock Draft 2.0 is still subject to a ton of changes, but takes into account all the CURRENT roster
                                and needs of all NFL teams (no hypothetical free agent signings).

                                This year’s MLB free agency started off wild to say the least. Starting at the Winter Meetings, December has created some
                                fantastic storylines that kept baseball fans on the edge of their seats. Recently, teams have calmed down and moves are
                                coming in slower and slower.

                                and Marcell Ozuna, deals have been coming in fast and are sure to continue.

                                 Here are 4 possible moves that I personally find extremely interesting (whether they actually happen or not), and why they
                                work. Please note: these are not predictions (although I’m not inventing rumors out of nowhere), just me having some fun
                                with what could happen.

                            <h2>1. Bogdan Bogdanovic - SG, SF - Sacramento Kings (37% owned in Yahoo leagues)</h2>
                            <p>
                                The first player on the list is a name not many people know at this moment. Bogdan originally came from the Euro League and
                                was drafted by Pho26 points, 4 rebounds and 6 assists.
