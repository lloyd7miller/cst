                                The NBA All Star weekend is here, marking just past the halfway point in the NBA season. While the NBA season ends in just
                                a couple of months, the NBA fantasy season ends just a few weeks before, meaning this is crunch time for any NBA fantasy
                                team trying to make the playoffs. A ton of leagues have their trade deadlines coming up very soon, if they haven’t passed
                                already. Fantasy teams, just like real NBA teams, are looking for the final pieces they need to go for that deep playoff
                                run. Whether it’s through trade or pickup, there are some players out there who can make a difference on YOUR roster
                                from now until the finals. Here are 5 players you should buy/pickup & 5 players you should trade/drop before it’s too
                                late!
                            </p>

                            <h2>1. Bogdan Bogdanovic - SG, SF - Sacramento Kings (37% owned in Yahoo leagues)</h2>
                            <p>
                                The first player on the list is a name not many people know at this moment. Bogdan originally came from the Euro League and
                                was drafted by Phoenix in the 2014 NBA draft before being traded to Sacramento in the Marquese Chriss deal. In his first
                                season up to now, Bogdan is averaging 11.5 points, 3.2 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game (solid numbers for a rookie).
                                This isn’t what makes him an interesting pickup now though. Bogdan seems to have a ton of upside in picking him up, and
                                the recent numbers (albeit in a short time frame) to be worth a waiver flyer. With the Kings in tank mode, the best course
                                of action for them would be to put the ball in their young players hands and give them the experience they need to develop.
                                This means more minutes for young role players like Justin Jackson, Frank Mason III, Skal Labissiere and more offense
                                running through starters like De’Aaron Fox and Bogdan Bogdanovic. While Fox has shown some inconsistencies, Bogdan seems
                                to be the focal point of this Kings offense. His minutes have increased, 31.6 over his past 5 games, and so has his productivity.
                                Over those same 5 games, he’s averaging 15.4 points 4.8 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game. Another reason to buy the
                                Bogdan hype? He just shined this weekend, taking home MVP of the 2018 Rising Stars challenge, leading Team World to a
                                155-124 win over Team USA with his 26 points, 4 rebounds and 6 assists.
