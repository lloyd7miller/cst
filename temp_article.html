        Feels so good to be back again writing come college football prediction! So much is happening but we here at Casual
        Sports Talk remember where we started, right here writing predictions!

        Last week there was no article as Ethan was moving into University, but if you checked twitter (@CasualSportsPod) you
        would have seen his picks for the week! All in all, Ethan went 4-3-0 ATS (including 2 predictions made on opening
        Thursday night).
