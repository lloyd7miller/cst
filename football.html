                    <h2>2018 NFL Mock Draft 1.0</h2>
                    <p>
                        Well the NFL seasons almost coming to a close and that only means one things… its mock draft season! Personally one of my
                        favorite times of the year, where experts and amateurs alike prove that they can’t ever predict what truly happens at the
                        NFL draft. With that being said, NFL mock drafts are one of my favorites things to do and you guys are going to be seeing
                        a lot of them here on Casual Sports Talk. With so many questions in the air about NFL teams, no mock draft made right now
                        will be able to predict what accurately will happen on April 26. We’re going to call ...

                    <h2>Super Bowl Predictions & Bets</h2>
                    <p>
                         Sunday, February 4th, 2018 marks the end of the 2017-2018 NFL 
                         season. The Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots 
                         are going to face off in Minnesota to see who calls themselves world champions.

                    <p>Both teams entered the playoffs 13-3 and atop their respective conferences, but it seems the Eagles we’re clear underdogs
                    throughout the playoffs after losing their QB, Carson Wentz. They carry this “underdog” title into the Super Bowl, where
                    the line opened as New England favored by 5.5 points, the highest since 2009. As the days got closer, the line has dropped
                    to 4.5 and that’s where its been sitting for the past couple of days...</p>
