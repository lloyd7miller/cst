            So a lot has happened since our last mock draft… Free agency signings and trades galore have altered many
            teams draft needs
            and even draft position. With that being said, here’s CST’s official Mock Draft version 3.0.
            Make sure to go check out Version 1.0 and Version 2.0 of our mock drafts to compare and contrast the
            differences.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Special surprise: it’s a FULL 2 ROUND Mock Draft, enjoy!
        </p>

        <h3>1. Cleveland Browns</h3>
        <h5>Pick: Sam Darnold, QB, Southern California</h5>

            I am flip-flopping a lot on this pick, but I am still convinced
            that Saquon Barkley SHOULD be taken 1st. That being said,
            the Tyrod Taylor trade convinces me that they will pick Darnold
            at 1. Tyrod is being looked at as a ‘bridge QB’ in this scenario
            and Cleveland looks to want their franchise QB for years to come.
            Yes, I do believe Saquon is a once-in-a-generation running
            back and that they should take him here… but I can realistically
            see them going QB at 1 to ensure they get the guy they want.

            After the NFL Combine that took place last weekend in Indianapolis, I felt a second version of my mock
            draft was certainly
            needed. Mock draft season lives, and many more drafts will be released in between now and April 26th.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The second version of CST’s official Mock Draft takes into account all the moves NFL teams have made from
            the release of
            the first mock draft until now. As well, this mock draft is the first mock draft in the series that will
            take into
            account the results of the recent NFL Combine.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Just a reminder that this Mock Draft 2.0 is still subject to a ton of changes, but takes into account all
            the CURRENT roster
            and needs of all NFL teams (no hypothetical free agent signings).

            <h2>4 Moves to Improve the MLB Offseason</h2>

        <p>
            This year’s MLB free agency started off wild to say the least. Starting at the Winter Meetings, December
            has created some
            fantastic storylines that kept baseball fans on the edge of their seats. Recently, teams have calmed down
            and moves are
            coming in slower and slower.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            From the high profile signings/trades of Stanton & Ohtani, to the potential franchise changing acquisitions
            of Carlos Santana
            and Marcell Ozuna, deals have been coming in fast and are sure to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
            [...]
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are 4 possible moves that I personally find extremely interesting (whether they actually happen or
            not), and why they
            work. Please note: these are not predictions (although I’m not inventing rumors out of nowhere), just me
            having some fun
            with what could happen.
        </p>
